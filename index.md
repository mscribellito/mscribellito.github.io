# About

I've been programming since I was about 15, writing awful messes in spaghetti PHP. Fast forward to now and I have learned how to a) program in a bunch of other languages, and, b) design and implement complex solutions. Every line of code allows me to create, mold and perfect the solution I am developing. I am always eager to learn something new, so I try to push myself every day.

Experience, education and certifications are on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mscribellito/).
